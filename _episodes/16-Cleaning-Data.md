## Coded missing values
- Converting coded missing values to NA (eg 999 or -1)
- `mutate` with `case_when` or `ifelse`

## Removing outliers/errors
- It can be appropriate to remove outliers
- Do so conservatively by creating a new variable without outliers

## Fill
- Fill down for missing values that shouldn't be empty

> ## Challenge 1
> Use [dataset] to:
> 1. Reshape it to be tidy
> 2. Recode values stored as -1 to be NA
