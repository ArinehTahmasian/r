All the functions we have looked at so far work with a single data frame and modify it in some way.
It is common, however, that your data may not be stored in a single, complete, form and instead will
be found in a number of places. Perhaps measurements taken in different weeks have been saved to 
separate places, or maybe you have different files recording observations and metadata. To work with
data stored like this it is necessary to learn how to combine and merge different datasets into a
single data frame.

## Combining data

If you have multiple data frames that you wish to combine, you can do so with `bind_rows()` or 
`bind_cols()`


~~~
data = data_frame(numbers = c(1, 2, 3, 4), letters = c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning: `data_frame()` is deprecated, use `tibble()`.

# A tibble: 4 x 2
  numbers letters
    <dbl> <chr>  
1       1 a      
2       2 b      
3       3 c      
4       4 d      
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
new_data <- data_frame(numbers = c(24, 25, 26), letters = c("x", "y", "z"))

bind_rows(data, new_data)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 7 x 2
  numbers letters
    <dbl> <chr>  
1       1 a      
2       2 b      
3       3 c      
4       4 d      
5      24 x      
6      25 y      
7      26 z

Use dummy data, and add a new column, or new rows

* Bind Columns
* Bind Rows

## Joins

Use nycflights13 (will need to install). Potntially a common structure. One main data table, then a
number of supplementary metadata tables (or with `weather`, another data table of different measurements)


Can combine these in a number of ways.


* Inner
* Left
* Right
* Full
* Anti
* Semi
