## When (not) to write data
- Intermediate files do not need to be written

## Where (not) to write data
- Write to a relative path if it should be stored in the repository/project
- Only for moderately sized data that should travel with the project
- Absolute paths may be appropriate for fixed storage locations (would be better set as a variable...)

## Data writing formats
- Similar considerations for reading - where will it be going?
- Plain text is usually best, especially for dataframes

## How to write
- `write_` family of functions, especially `write_csv`

> ## Challenge 1
