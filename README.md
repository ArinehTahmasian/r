# Introduction to R 

This lesson provides an overall introduction to R, with a particular emphasis on the [tidyverse](tidyverse.org). It is heavily based on a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) introductory [lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder), but the overall structure of the lesson has been changed to focus more directly on the tidyverse.
