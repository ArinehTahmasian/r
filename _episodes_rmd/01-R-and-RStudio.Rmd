## Why should you use R?


## Tour of R Studio
*Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console/terminal (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

<!--![RStudio layout](../fig/01-rstudio.png) -->

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

<!--![RStudio layout with .R file open](../fig/01-rstudio-script.png) -->

You can move the panels around in RStudio so that their arrangement suits you.

Your time in R will be split between the R interactive
console working in scripts. The console is where you will run all of your code, and can be a useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.


## Show code in R

R can be used as a calculator:

```{r}
1 + 100
```
## Show code in R Studio

Now you will enter some calculations into your script file, and either copy this to the 
console window or highlight the code and Control Enter to run the code.  Notice that
the output is show in the console window.
```{r}
(3 + 5) * 2
```




## Work flow within RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
a .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's short cut keys for the Run command
to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
   or using R's `source()`  function.

> ## Tip: Running segments of your code
>
> RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
> window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
> current line, you can 1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel,
> or 2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or 3. hit
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux or
> <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X. (This shortcut can also 
> be seen by hovering
> the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
> If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
> there is no need to reselct the section and `Run`, you can use the next button
> along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
> including the modifications you have made.

# Projects

R Studio provides in-built support for keeping all files associated with a project 
together.  This includes the input data, R Scripts, analytical results and figures.

> ## Challenge: Creating a self-contained project
>
> We're going to create a new project in RStudio:
>
> 1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
> 2. Click "New Directory".
> 3. Click "Empty Project".
> 4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. "my_project".
> 5. If available, select the checkbox for "Create a git repository."
> 6. Click the "Create Project" button.
